// Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

// The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

// Note:

// Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
// You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
// Example:

// Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
// Output: [1,2]
// Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
